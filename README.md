# Alexa Skill: Twin Peaks Game
Modifying AWS's trivia template, I made a multiple choice Twin Peaks quiz for Amazon Alexa. It has since been published!

## Requirements
* [AWS Template](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia)
* [AWS Services account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
* [AWS Developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/)

## The Build
There are two parts to building an Alexa Skill. The first is making the skill service with AWS Lambda. The second is making the skill interface. This is where you set your invocation name, intent(s), slot type and utterances. If you'd like to take a peek at the questions, they're in the index.js file! With a template this was a really satisfying project to make, and a great introduction to Amazon Web Services.
